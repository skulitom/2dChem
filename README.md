# 2D Chemistry Simulation Game

A powder-game style physics simulation exploring the emergent chemical and physical behavior in a two-dimensional (2D) universe. This project provides a conceptual framework for how fundamental quantum and classical principles might manifest if our familiar 3D chemistry were instead constrained to a plane. Though this simulation is intrinsically a simplification, it incorporates rigorously considered theoretical principles to enhance scientific plausibility.

## Scientific Foundation: 2D Chemical Physics

In our familiar three-dimensional (3D) world, chemical behavior arises from quantum mechanical principles, electromagnetic interactions, and the arrangement of electrons in discrete orbitals around atomic nuclei. While these underlying laws do not change when considered in two dimensions, their mathematical form and resultant properties differ markedly due to altered spatial symmetries and scaling laws.

This simulation attempts to approximate how atoms, molecules, and materials would behave under a hypothetical 2D physical regime. While it cannot capture all subtleties of a truly 2D quantum field theory, it draws from known principles in lower-dimensional systems from theoretical physics and computational chemistry.

### Electromagnetic Force in 2D

In 3D, the electromagnetic force between two point charges, as described by Coulomb's Law, decreases with the square of the distance (1/r²). The underlying reason is geometric: the electric field radiates outward in three dimensions, causing a dilution of field intensity proportional to the surface area of a sphere (~r²).

In a strict 2D environment, the electric field lines would radiate in a plane, spreading over the circumference of a circle. This leads to an inverse linear dependence (1/r) of the force. Such a difference profoundly affects the stability, energy spacing, and configuration of electron orbitals, giving rise to a unique set of "chemical" behaviors.

## Quantum Mechanics in Two Dimensions

### Quantum Numbers in 2D

While 3D quantum systems rely on four quantum numbers (n, l, m_l, m_s), the 2D analog is subtly different:

- **Principal Quantum Number (n)**: Defines the energy level (n = 1, 2, 3, ...).
- **Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l)**: For a given n, l ranges from 0 to (n – 1).
- **Magnetic Quantum Number (m_l)**: In two dimensions, the concept of directional angular momentum is reduced. For l > 0, there are generally two orientations, corresponding to clockwise or counterclockwise angular momentum states. Thus, m_l = ±l.
- **Spin Quantum Number (m_s)**: As in 3D, electrons possess spin ±½, an intrinsic property independent of spatial dimension.

### Electron Orbitals in 2D

#### s Orbitals (l = 0):
- Symmetry: Circularly symmetric (no angular nodes)
- Number of orbitals per n for l=0: 1 orbital
- Each orbital accommodates 2 electrons (spin-up and spin-down)

#### p, d, f, ... Orbitals (l > 0):
- Each nonzero l corresponds to exactly 2 orbitals (m_l = +l and m_l = -l)
- Each orbital holds 2 electrons by spin pairing
- Total electron capacity per l > 0 level: 2 orbitals × 2 electrons = 4 electrons

### Electron Shell Structure

The electron counting in 2D orbitals differs from that in 3D. Assuming a hydrogenic-like model and analogous stability trends, we obtain:

#### First Shell (n = 1):
- l = 0 only
- Total: 1 orbital × 2 electrons = 2 electrons

#### Second Shell (n = 2):
- l = 0: 2 electrons
- l = 1: 4 electrons
- Total: 2 + 4 = 6 electrons

#### Third Shell (n = 3):
- l = 0: 2 electrons
- l = 1: 4 electrons
- l = 2: 4 electrons
- Total: 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 electrons

#### Fourth Shell (n = 4):
- l = 0: 2 electrons
- l = 1: 4 electrons
- l = 2: 4 electrons
- l = 3: 4 electrons
- Total: 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14 electrons

Although these patterns resemble a systematic progression, the actual energy ordering of orbitals can differ significantly from simple n, l considerations due to the altered electromagnetic scaling (1/r). Detailed computational methods would be required to establish the precise energetic hierarchy, but this model provides a reasonable conceptual starting point.

### Valence Electrons and the "Sextet Rule"

Analogous to the octet rule in 3D chemistry, stable 2D atoms strive to fill their outer shells. In 2D, the second shell holds up to six electrons, making the "sextet rule" the conceptual analog. Achieving six valence electrons often confers stability and chemical inertness, defining the 2D analog of "noble gases."

## The 2D Periodic Table

The organization of elements in 2D would yield a novel periodic classification. Periods still correspond to the filling of electron shells, while groups reflect similarities in valence electron configurations. However, the patterns of stable configurations, reactive tendencies, and periodic trends may differ widely:

- **Noble Gases**: Possess a filled valence shell (e.g., 2, 6, 12, 20 electrons total)
- **Halogens**: Have five valence electrons, seeking one more to achieve a sextet
- **Alkali Metals**: Contain one valence electron, readily losing it to achieve a filled inner shell
- **Transition Metals**: Involve higher l-level orbitals, but the exact sequence of filling diverges from the familiar 3D scenario

## Chemical Bonding in 2D

### Covalent Bonding
Covalent bonds result from electron sharing to complete a sextet. The range of possible bonds—single (2-electron), double (4-electron), and triple (6-electron)—is somewhat compressed compared to 3D chemistry due to the sextet limit.

### Ionic Bonding
Ionic bonding arises from complete electron transfer. Positively and negatively charged ions form stable lattice structures in a plane.

### Metallic Bonding
In metallic bonds, valence electrons are delocalized, flowing freely among an array of metal atoms. The resulting 2D electron "sea" fosters electrical conductivity.

### Intermolecular Forces
Intermolecular interactions, including dipole-dipole, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonds, persist in 2D, though with modified properties.

## Thermodynamics and Kinetics in 2D

Thermodynamic concepts translate to 2D with modifications:
- **Pressure**: Defined as force per unit length rather than per unit area
- **Phase Diagrams**: Reflect 2D analogs of temperature and pressure relations
- **Reaction Kinetics**: Reaction rates depend on planar collision frequencies
