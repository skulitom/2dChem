# 2D Chemistry Simulation Game
A powder-game style physics simulation exploring chemical interactions in a 2D world.

## Scientific Foundation: 2D Chemical Physics

### 2D Electron Configuration Theory
In our 2D universe, quantum mechanics operates differently:

1. **Electron Shell Structure**
   - 1st shell (n=1): 2 electrons (1s²)
   - 2nd shell (n=2): 6 electrons (2s², 2p⁴)
   - 3rd shell (n=3): 10 electrons (3s², 3p⁴, 3d⁴)
   - 4th shell (n=4): 14 electrons (4s², 4p⁴, 4d⁴, 4f⁴)

2. **Orbital Theory in 2D**
   - s-orbitals: Circular symmetry (2 electrons)
   - p-orbitals: 2 lobes × 2 orientations (4 electrons)
   - d-orbitals: 4 orientations (4 electrons)
   - f-orbitals: 4 orientations (4 electrons)

3. **Valence Rules**
   - Octet rule becomes "Sextet rule" (6 electrons)
   - Maximum valence electrons: 6
   - Hybridization patterns: sp¹, sp²

### Chemical Bonding in 2D

1. **Covalent Bonding**
   - Single bonds: 2 electrons
   - Double bonds: 4 electrons
   - Triple bonds: 6 electrons (maximum possible)
   - Bond angles: 120° for sp² hybridization

2. **Ionic Bonding**
   - Modified electronegativity scale
   - Maximum charge states: ±3
   - Crystal lattice structures in 2D

3. **Intermolecular Forces**
   - Van der Waals forces
   - 2D hydrogen bonding
   - Dipole-dipole interactions

### Thermodynamics & Kinetics

1. **State Properties**
   - Temperature affects particle velocity
   - Pressure calculated from particle collisions
   - Volume becomes area in 2D

2. **Phase Transitions**
   - Modified phase diagrams
   - Critical points adjusted for 2D
   - Surface tension effects

3. **Reaction Kinetics**
   - Collision theory modified for 2D
   - Activation energy barriers
   - Catalyst behavior
